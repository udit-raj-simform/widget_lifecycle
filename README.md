# Widget LifeCycle

This Flutter project is made to help you understand how the widget lifecycle completes and when each of the existing methods is called in a widget lifecycle.

## Implementation

- Create a new project
- Change distributionUrl version from 7.5 to 7.6 in android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
- Add the following code in lib/main.dart to your project
- Run the application
